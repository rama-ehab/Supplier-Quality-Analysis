# Supplier-Quality-Analysis
The Supplier Quality Analysis project aimed to evaluate and enhance supplier performance by leveraging advanced data analysis techniques. Using Excel Power Query, the data was transformed and cleansed to ensure consistency and accuracy, while SQL was employed to manage and query large datasets effectively. Tableau was used to create interactive dashboards and visualizations, providing clear insights into key metrics such as defect rates and compliance with quality standards.

The analysis helped identify underperforming suppliers, highlight improvement areas, and track quality trends over time. By delivering actionable insights, the project contributed to strengthening supplier relationships, ensuring adherence to quality benchmarks, and optimizing procurement processes. This comprehensive approach improved decision-making and enhanced overall supply chain efficiency.
